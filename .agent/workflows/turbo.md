// turbo-all

This workflow enables automatic command execution without user approval.

When working on the front-yoel project:

1. All npm commands can run automatically
2. File operations are approved
3. Build and test commands are safe to run
4. Git commands require review

Common commands used in this project:
- npm run dev
- npm run build  
- npm install
- mkdir/touch/mv/cp operations
